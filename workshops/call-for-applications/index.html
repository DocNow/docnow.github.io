    <h3>Community-Based Digital Archives Workshops for Activists</h3>
    <p>Documenting the Now is accepting <a href="https://go.umd.edu/applydocnow">applications</a> from US-based social justice activist organizations that would like to benefit from a free community-based digital archives workshop in their city or town in 2020. The workshops will focus on helping activists to develop the skills and to use available tools to collect, preserve, and share their web, social media and other types of digital content in their own digital archive. Our hope is that activist communities, in creating their own archives, will be able to better document their activities, assert a greater level of control over their own narratives, and secure access to digital content that has been safely captured and preserved through methods that will allow that content to be authenticated at a later date for evidentiary, research, or other purposes. As part of the workshop, our trainers will also share knowledge about digital security and surveillance, as these are issues that negatively impact modern day social justice activism. During the workshops, participants will:
      <ul>
        <li>Build a community-based digital archive for their organization.</li>
        <li>Gain a better understanding about data collection, digital security, and surveillance issues around web and social media content.</li>
        <li>Gain new knowledge about digital content generated on mobile devices and develop skills to safely archive that content.</li>
        <li>Build relationships with local archivists and other historical documenters in your city.</li>
        <li>Engage in conversations leading to deeper understanding about how digital content generated in online spaces affects our personal, social, and professional lives.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
