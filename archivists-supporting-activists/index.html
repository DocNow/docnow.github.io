    <h1>Archivists Supporting Activists</h1>
    <p>In response to the ongoing police violence at protests
      in the wake of the Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd,
      Documenting the Now put out a call for archivists to help support
      activists documenting this violence. These archivist volunteers practice non-extractive,
      anti-racist ethical approaches to archiving, and have attested that they are in no way connected
      to law enforcement.<br><br>
      This list is meant to be used as a resource for activists who could use assistance
      in building their archives.<br>
