<p>The DocNow application requires user management, storage &amp; Twitter API management, and consent conversation management. Each of these activities should have email notifications to alert users of actions they need to take.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>In order to accomplish this we will need to have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ability for application to send emails</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>Create a set of standard email alerts that are triggered based on various conditions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alert app administrator when a new user joins</li>
  <li>Alert new user that their account must be activated by administrator</li>
  <li>Alert new user when account has been activated, noting max-storage user limit</li>
  <li>Alert administrator when user has deleted account</li>
  <li>Alert user when administrator has de-activated account, with ability to reply to appeal de-activation
*</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Alert user when storage limit has been reached and how to fix problem</li>
  <li>Administrator recurring email of overall storage # and active users</li>
