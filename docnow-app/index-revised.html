              <p>We built this tool slowly and intentionally, with community input along the way. We have released
                the tool freely, and share the open source code on GitHub for all to use and modify. We do ask that our
                users read and comply with our <a href="/">terms of service</a>. In launching V1.0,
              we are seeking user feedback to assess how we can improve DocNow. <a href="/">Sign up</a> to be an early tester! </p>
