      <div class="col-lg-12 text-left">
        <p class="bigp">1. Join Documenting the Now's hosted community instance.</p>
        <p>We host a <a href="https://community.docnow.io/">community instance</a> of the DocNow application for anyone to use. It's a great way to get familiar with the tool before committing to running an instance yourself. Please make sure to read the terms of service when you sign up.

        <p>Have development skills? Looking to test the application, but not necessarily collect long-term? You can <a href="https://docnow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/local/">run DocNow locally</a> on your computer by installing just a few packages.</p>

        <p class="bigp">3. Install your own instance in the cloud.</p>
        <p>For production-level collecting and the ability to build out your own community of users and terms of service, you'll want to run your own DocNow <a href="https://docnow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud/"> instance in the cloud</a>. We have instructions
        for a variety of cloud service providers and are looking for community input on further documentation.</a></p>

          <h2>Why use DocNow?</h2>
          <br>
          <div class="col-lg-10 text-left">
            <p class="bigp">DocNow's features and technology were built with a community-centered ethic of care.</p>
            <p>We built this tool slowly and intentionally, with community input along the way. We have released
              the tool freely, and share the open source code on GitHub for all to use and modify. We do ask that our
              users read and comply with our terms of service. In launching V1.0,
            we are seeking user feedback (questionnaire coming soon) to assess how we can improve DocNow.
