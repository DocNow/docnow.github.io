          <p class="bigp">DocNow's features and technology were built with a community-centered ethic of care.</p>
          <p>We built this tool slowly and intentionally, with community input along the way. We have released
            the tool freely, and share the open source code on GitHub for all to use and modify. We do ask that our
            users read and comply with our <a href="/">terms of service</a>, and practice ethical archiving. In launching V1.0,
          we are seeking user feedback to assess how we can improve DocNow. </p>
