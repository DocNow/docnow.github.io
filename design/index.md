## Design Documents

In the second phase of the Documenting the Now project we started writing up
brief design documents that help us organize our work at a level of granularity
somewhere between the global [Project Roadmap] and what is provided by task
management tools like GitHub, Trello and Asana during our sprints. The idea is
for these documents to pitch and socialize a broad area of work before diving
into the nuts and bolts of the work. They also serve as a record of the work we
have focused on, and help us see how our ideas may have changed over time.

Please feel free to ask questions in the [Issue Tracker] for this website, in
[Slack], or to drop us an email at info@docnow.io.
