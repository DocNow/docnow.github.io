## Design Documents

In the second phase of the Documenting the Now project we started writing up
brief design documents that help us organize work at a level of granularity
somewhere between the global [Project Roadmap] and the granularity that GitHub,
Trello and Asana tickets provide in individual sprints. These may get shared
internally as Google Docs and the like, but eventually they make it here for
feedback from a wider audience.

Please feel free to ask questions in the [Issue Tracker] for this website, in
[Slack], or to drop us an email at info@docnow.io.
