    <h2>Digital Blackness in the Archive: A Documenting the Now Symposium</h2>
    <h3>December 10-12, 2017 | #BlackDigArchive</h3>
    <p>The second Documenting the Now symposium, to be held in conjunction with our advisory board meeting,
      will address issues at the intersection on archival practice and the existence of Black people on the
      web and social media. Invited speakers and panelists will discuss their work on the Black experience
      in online spaces including Black joy and creativity, cultural and social expression, activism and
      resilience, state sponsored digital surveillance, inherent racism and bias in algorithm and platform
      design, digital humanities, and ethical data collection. The program will be an opportunity for the
      general public, activists, archivists, and the academic community, to learn and share in conversations
      about digital archives that center blackness. Because we too often attempt to find solutions before
      fully grasping the issues, an intentional goal of the program will be to broaden understanding of the
      realities faced by Black people participating in online spaces, in hopes that this knowledge will impact
      how archivists do their work around appraisal, collection, access, and long term preservation of social
      media and other web based content that document Black lives.</p>
